		// Enhanced FAQs with more detailed answers
		faqs: [
			{
				question: "Which ITR form is applicable for me?",
				answer:
					"The applicable ITR form depends on your income sources:\n\n• ITR-1 (Sahaj): For residents with income up to ₹50 lakhs from salary, one house property, and other sources (excluding lottery/gambling)\n\n• ITR-2: For individuals with income from salary, more than one house property, capital gains, and foreign income\n\n• ITR-3: For individuals and HUFs having income from business or profession\n\n• ITR-4 (Sugam): For presumptive income from business or profession\n\nOur experts will determine the correct form based on your specific financial situation and ensure all income sources are properly reported.",
			},
			{
				question: "What documents do I need to provide for ITR filing?",
				answer:
					"Essential documents for ITR filing include:\n\n• Form 16 from your employer(s)\n• Form 26AS (tax credit statement)\n• Bank statements for all accounts\n• Investment proof for tax-saving deductions (80C, 80D, etc.)\n• Home loan interest certificate (if applicable)\n• Rent receipts and rent agreement if claiming HRA\n• Capital gains statements for investments (if applicable)\n\nFor business income, you'll also need:\n• Profit and loss statement\n• Balance sheet\n• Bank statements for business accounts\n• GST returns (if registered)\n\nOur document checklist tool can help you organize everything needed for your specific situation.",
			},
			{
				question: "Is it mandatory to file an income tax return?",
				answer:
					"ITR filing is mandatory if your gross total income exceeds the basic exemption limit (₹2.5 lakhs for individuals under 60 years, ₹3 lakhs for seniors 60-80 years, and ₹5 lakhs for super seniors above 80).\n\nHowever, filing returns is highly advisable even if your income is below the threshold for several reasons:\n\n• It creates an official income record\n• Helps in loan applications and visa processing\n• Allows claiming tax refunds\n• Prevents potential penalties if your income is reassessed\n• Enables carrying forward losses to future years\n\nRegular filing also establishes a good financial discipline and tax compliance history.",
			},
			{
				question: "What is the deadline for filing ITR?",
				answer:
					"The standard deadlines for ITR filing are:\n\n• July 31st: For individuals and entities not requiring audit\n• October 31st: For businesses and professionals requiring tax audit\n\nThese dates may be extended by the government in special circumstances. If you miss the regular deadline, you can still file a belated return with penalties:\n\n• By December 31st: Late fee ranging from ₹1,000 to ₹10,000 based on income level\n• By March 31st: Higher penalties may apply\n\nImportant: Belated returns have disadvantages including inability to carry forward certain losses (except house property losses), potential interest on unpaid taxes, and limitations on revising the return later.",
			},
			{
				question: "How long does it take to process my tax return?",
				answer:
					"Our service timeline for processing your tax return:\n\n1. Initial Assessment: 1-2 business days after document submission\n2. Query Resolution: Depends on complexity of your case\n3. ITR Preparation: 2-3 business days\n4. Your Review & Approval: Depends on your response time\n5. E-filing: 1 business day after your approval\n\nAfter filing, the Income Tax Department typically processes returns within:\n• 20-45 days for e-verified returns\n• 60-90 days for physically verified returns\n\nRefunds (if applicable) are usually issued within 20-30 days after processing is complete. Our client portal provides real-time updates on your return status throughout this process.",
			},
			{
				question: "What happens if I miss the ITR filing deadline?",
				answer:
					"If you miss the July 31st deadline:\n\n1. You can file a belated return until December 31st of the assessment year with penalties:\n   • Income up to ₹5 lakhs: ₹1,000 late fee\n   • Income above ₹5 lakhs: ₹5,000 late fee\n\n2. Filing after December 31st but before March 31st involves:\n   • Higher late fees (up to ₹10,000)\n   • Interest on unpaid tax @ 1% per month under Section 234A\n   • Potential notice from tax department\n\n3. Key disadvantages of belated filing:\n   • Cannot carry forward most losses (except house property loss)\n   • Limited ability to revise return later\n   • May trigger scrutiny in some cases\n   • Delays in refund processing\n\nWe recommend setting up advance reminders through our system to avoid missing deadlines in the future.",
			},
			{
				question: "Can I revise my ITR if I discover a mistake after filing?",
				answer:
					"Yes, you can file a revised return to correct errors or omissions if your original return was filed before the due date. Key points about ITR revision:\n\n• Revision Window: You can revise until the end of the assessment year or before completion of assessment, whichever is earlier (typically up to March 31st)\n\n• Number of Revisions: Multiple revisions are allowed within the timeframe\n\n• Process: Similar to original filing but select 'Revised Return' and provide original acknowledgment number\n\n• Belated Returns: If you filed after the due date (belated return), revision options are more limited\n\n• Common Revisions: Income omissions, incorrect deductions, calculation errors\n\nOur post-filing review service can help identify potential errors before they become issues with tax authorities.",
			},
			{
				question:
					"What are the different modes of verification after filing ITR?",
				answer:
					"After filing your ITR, you must verify it within 120 days. Available verification methods include:\n\n• Aadhaar OTP: Instant verification using Aadhaar-linked mobile number\n• Net Banking: Verify through your bank's online portal\n• Bank ATM: Generate EVC through selected bank ATMs\n• Digital Signature: Using valid Digital Signature Certificate (DSC)\n• Demat Account: Through EVC generated via your demat account\n• Physical Form ITR-V: Print, sign and mail to CPC Bengaluru (if electronic methods not feasible)\n\nWe recommend Aadhaar OTP verification for fastest processing and refunds. Our system guides you through the most appropriate verification method based on your situation.",
